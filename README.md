This package contains samples of as many javascript data types as possible along with the groups they belong to. The samples can be used to write unit tests for example. 

For example, the number 1 belongs to the groups number, positive and strictlyPositive. 

```js
{
	value: 1,
	name: '1',
	isNumber: true,
	isPositive: true,
	isStrictlyPositive: true
}
```

Of course, the samples need to be updated with new JavaScript versions and groups can to be added by the community through pull requests.
